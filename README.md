An idea for smart contract code auditing
1. It can support automated code auditing, which can statically scan the entire code and use AI big models to determine its potential risks.

2. Since wallet phishing often happens, it will cause users to lose a lot of assets. I want to add phishing site tips and judgment functions to it
